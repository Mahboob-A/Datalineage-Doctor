## Project Overview

DataLineage Doctor is a solo-built hackathon project for the OpenMetadata Hackathon (April 17–26, 2026). It is a FastAPI + Celery application that receives OpenMetadata `testCaseFailed` webhook events, runs an LLM-powered root cause analysis agent, and returns a structured RCA report with timeline, blast radius, and remediation steps. The dashboard is a Jinja2-rendered web UI.

**Submission deadline:** April 26, 2026 (9 days from project start)
**Demo video required:** Yes — 3 to 5 minutes
**Prize target:** 1st place (MacBook)

React Flow lineage graph, incident detail page, timeline UI, Slack notification, OM incident creation.

**Sprint 4 — Observability + Polish** (April 23–24)
Grafana dashboard wired to Prometheus metrics, seed script, trigger script, `make demo` one-command flow, README.

**Sprint 5 — Demo + Submission** (April 25–26)
Demo video recording, submission write-up, final README review.

## Decisions Made This Session

_(Update this section at the end of each working session with any decisions made that are not already captured in other knowledge docs.)_

- Sprint 1 completed via agent-plan-sprint-1-1.
- Used local `uv` validation (`pytest` + `ruff`) due Docker daemon unavailability.
- Completed 21 tests passing locally and lint clean.
- Sprint 2 core tooling (DLD-011 to DLD-017) remains complete, with local lint passing and `40` tests passing.
- Seed and trigger scripts are implemented for Sprint 2 demo flow; DLD-018 now passes live OM validation and idempotency.
- Local runtime was restored by starting Docker Compose and refreshing the OpenMetadata JWT used by the repo.
- Switched the live RCA provider to Gemini 2.5 Flash using the existing OpenAI-compatible integration path.
- Refreshed `OM_JWT_TOKEN` and recreated `app` and `worker`, restoring authenticated OM access after the stack restart.
- DLD-019 now passes live validation with a HIGH-confidence RCA, 4 timeline events, 4 blast-radius consumers, and `/metrics` recording `rca_requests_total{status="success"} 1.0`.
- Sprint 2 completed via agent-plan-sprint-2-1.
